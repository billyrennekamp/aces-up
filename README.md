Vue 2.0 + Webpack Build of Aces Up Solitaire

Aces Up (also known as Idiot's Delight, Once in a Lifetime, Ace of the Pile, Rocket to the Top, Firing Squad, Loser Solitaire, Aces High, and Drivel) is a solitaire card game using a deck of 52 playing cards. One advantage of this game is its minimal use of space: one can even play it on an area as small as an encyclopedia volume cover.
